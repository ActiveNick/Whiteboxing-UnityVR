# Whiteboxing-UnityVR
Experimental testbed where I test various VR concepts using Windows Mixed Reality in Unity. Most of the scenes in this project should be treated as individual experiments and are works in progress. Additionally, while I make sure that my projects can successfully compile, build and run before pushing them to GitHub, there can certainly be functional bugs that i have not addressed yet, or may never address. Such is the nature of experiments. I am sharing these openly in case they can help someone else looking at similar principles. Like all my GitHub samples, this project is provided "as is". Use at your own discretion, you've been warned.

- **Unity version:** 2017.2.2p2
- **Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) version:** Dev_Working_Branch (not an official release yet)
